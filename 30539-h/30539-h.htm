<h1><span class="sp1">The<br />
TERRIBLE<br />
ANSWER</span></h1>

<h2>By Arthur G. Hill</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> came down to Mars ahead
of the rest because Larkin had
bought an unfair advantage&mdash;a
copy of the Primary Report. There
were seven of them, all varying in
appearance, but with one thing in
common; in the eyes of each
glowed the greed for Empire. They
came down in a flash of orange tail-fire
and they looked first at the
Martians.</p>

<p>"Green," marveled Evans. "What
a queer shade of green!"</p>

<p>"Not important," Cleve, the psychologist,
replied. "Merely a matter
of pigmentation. White, yellow,
black, green. It proves only that
God loves variety."</p>

<p>"And lord how they grin!"</p>

<p>Cleve peered learnedly. "Doesn't
indicate a thing. They were born
with those grins. They'll die with
them."</p>

<p>Of the seven strong men, Larkin
exuded the most power. Thus, his
role of leader was a natural one.
No man would ever stand in front
of Larkin. He said, "To hell with
color or the shape of their mouths.
What we're after lies inside. Come
on. Let's set up a camp."</p>

<p>"For the time being," Cleve cautioned,
"we must ignore them.
Later&mdash;we know what to do. I'll
give the nod."</p>

<p>They brought what they needed
out of the ship. They brought the
plastic tents, broke the small, attached
cylinders, and watched the
tents bulge up into living quarters.
They set up the vapor condenser
and it began filling the water tank
from the air about them. They
plugged a line into the ship and attached
it to the tent-line. Immediately
the gasses in the plastic tents
began to glow and give off both
light and heat.</p>

<p>They did many things while the
Martians stood silently by with
their arms hanging, their splay-feet
flat on the ground, their slash-mouths
grinning.</p>

<p>The seven sat down to their first
meal under the Martian stars and
while they ate the rich, delicate
foods, they listened to the words of
Larkin. "A new empire waiting to
be built. A whole planet&mdash;virgin&mdash;new."</p>

<p>"Not new," Dane, the archeologist,
said. "It's older than Earth. It's
been worked before."</p>

<p>Larkin waved an impatient
hand. "But hardly scratched. It can
have risen and fallen a thousand
times for all we care. The important
thing is the vital ingredient of
empire. Is it here? Can it be harnessed?
Are we or are we not, on
the threshold of wealth, splendor,
and progress so great as to take
away the breath?"</p>

<p>And as Larkin spoke, all seven
men looked at the Martians; looked
covertly while appearing to study
the rolling plain and the purple
ridges far away; the texture of the
soil; the color of the sky; the food
on their plates; the steaming fragrance
of their coffee. They looked
at all these things but they studied
the Martians.</p>

<p>"Stupid-looking animals," Evans
muttered. "Odd though. So like us&mdash;yet
so different."</p>

<p>At first there had been only a
handful of Martians to grin at the
landing of the ship. Now they numbered
over a hundred, their ranks
augmented by stragglers who came
to stare with their fellows in happy
silence.</p>

<p>"The prospects are excellent,"
Cleve said. Then he jerked his attention
back to Larkin from whom
it had momentarily wandered.
When Larkin spoke, one listened.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Larkin</span> had been directing his
words toward a young man
named Smith. Smith had inherited
a great deal of money which was
fine. But Larkin wasn't too sure of
his qualifications otherwise. "&mdash;the
pyramids," Larkin was saying.
"Would they have ever been built
if the men up above&mdash;the men with
vision&mdash;had had to worry about a
payroll?"</p>

<p>Smith regarded the Martians
with not quite the impersonal stare
of the other six Earthlings. Once or
twice he grinned back at them. "I'll
grant the truth of what you say,"
he told Larkin, "but what good
were the pyramids? They're something
I could never figure."</p>

<p>Smith had a sardonic twist of
mouth that annoyed Larkin. "Let's
not quibble, man. I merely used the
pyramids as an example. Call them
Empire; call them any Empire on
Earth from the beginning of known
history and let's face facts."</p>

<p>"Facts?" Smith asked. He had
been looking at a six-foot-six Martian,
thinking what a magnificent
specimen he was. If only they'd
wipe off those silly grins.</p>

<p>"Yes, facts. The building must
be done. It is a law of nature. Man
must progress or not. And what empire
can arise without free labor?
Can we develop this planet at
union scale? Impossible! Yet it's
crying to be developed."</p>

<p>Cleve knocked the ashes off his
cigar and frowned. Being a man of
direct action, he inquired. "Do you
want your money back, Smith?"</p>

<p>The latter shook his head. "Oh
no! Don't get me wrong, gentlemen.
I'm for empire first, last and
always. And if we can lay the
foundations of one on the backs of
these stupid creatures, I'm for it."</p>

<p>"I still don't like your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My outspoken manner? Don't
give it a thought, old man. I just
don't want to be all cloyed up with
platitudes. If we're going to chain
the children of Israel into the house
of bondage, let's get on with it."</p>

<p>"I don't like your attitude," Larkin
said stubbornly. "In the long
run, it will benefit these people."</p>

<p>"Let's say, rather, that it may
benefit their children. I doubt if
these jokers will be around very
long after we start cracking the
whip."</p>

<p>Dane was stirred. "The whip,"
he murmured. "Symbol of empire."
But nobody heard him. They were
too busy listening to Larkin and
Smith&mdash;and watching the Martians.</p>

<p>The Martians stood around grinning,
waiting patiently for something
to happen. Larkin's attitude
toward them had changed again.
First there had been curiosity. Then
a narrow-eyed calculation; now he
regarded them with contempt. The
careful, studied checks and tests
would be made of course. But Larkin,
a man of sure instincts, had already
made up his mind.</p>

<p>He stretched luxuriously. "Let's
call it a day and turn in. Tomorrow
we'll go about the business at hand
with clearer heads."</p>

<p>"A good idea," Cleve said, "but
first, one little gesture. I think it
would be judicious." He eyed the
Martians, settling finally upon one&mdash;a
male&mdash;standing close and
somewhat apart from the rest.
Cleve scowled. Standing erect, he
called, "Hey&mdash;you!" He interpreted
the words with a beckoning gesture
of his arm. "Come here! Here, boy!
Over here!"</p>

<p>The Martian reacted with a
typically Earthian gesture. He
pointed to his own chest with one
green finger, while a questioning
expression reflected through the
eternal grin.</p>

<p>"Yes, you! On the double."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Martian came forward.
There was in his manner a slight
hesitation, and Smith expected to
see his hind quarters wriggle like
that of a dog&mdash;uncertain, but eager
to please.</p>

<p>Cleve pointed with a martinet
gesture toward the smoked-out
cigar butt he'd thrown to the
ground. "Pick it up!"</p>

<p>The Martian stood motionless.</p>

<p>"Pick&mdash;it&mdash;<i>up</i>, you stupid lout!"</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="360" height="500" alt="" title="" />
<i><small><b>Larkin&mdash;now beyond sanity&mdash;was
gibbering in the grave.</b></small></i></div>

<p>The Martian understood. With
a glad little whimper, he bent over
and took the cigar butt in his hand.</p>

<p>"There," Cleve said. "Garbage
can! Get it? <i>Garbage can.</i> Place for
trash&mdash;for cigar butts. Put it in
there."</p>

<p>Smith wasn't sure whether the
grin deepened or not. He thought
it did, as the Martian laid the cigar
butt carefully into the trash can.</p>

<p>"Okay, you fella," Cleve barked,
still scowling. "Back and away now.
Stay out there! Get it? Only come
when you're called."</p>

<p>It took a few eloquent gestures,
including the pantomime of swinging
a whip, before the Martian understood
and complied. After he
backed into the circle of his fellows,
Cleve dropped the cruel overseer
manner and turned with satisfaction
to Larkin. "I think there will
be no trouble at all," he said. "Tomorrow
we'll really get down to
cases. I predict smooth sailing."</p>

<p>They said goodnight to each
other and went about the business
of preparing for slumber. As he
raised the glowing flap of his tent,
Larkin saw Smith lounging in a
chair before the electric heat unit.
"Aren't you going to get some
sleep?"</p>

<p>"In a little while. I'm going to
wait around until those two famous
moons come. Want to see them first
hand."</p>

<p>"A waste of time," Larkin said.
"Better keep your mind on more
important things."</p>

<p>"Goodnight," Smith said. Larkin
did not reply, and Smith turned his
head to look at the Martians. He
wondered where they had come
from. They probably had a village
somewhere over the rise. He regarded
them without fear or apprehension
of what might occur during
the sleeping hours. He had read the
Primary Report, brought back by
the pioneer expedition. These people
were entirely harmless. Also
they were possessed of remarkable
stamina. They had stood for days,
watching the first expedition, grinning
at it, without nourishment of
any kind.</p>

<p>Maybe they live off the atmosphere,
Smith told himself dreamily.
At any rate, they were ideal
specimens to use as the foundation
stones of an empire. He lay back,
thinking of Larkin; he did not like
Larkin personally, but he had to
admire the steel in the man; the
unswerving determination that had
made him what he was.</p>

<p>His mind drifted back to the
things of beauty around him. The
far purple ridges had changed now,
as a light bloomed behind them to
gleam like azure through old crystal.
Then the two moons shot over
the horizon; huge silver bullets riding
the thin atmosphere.</p>

<p>The oldest planet. Had it ever
been great? Were the bones of any
dead civilizations mouldering beneath
this strange yellow soil?
Smith closed his eyes while the cool
Martian breezes soothed his face.
Greatness. What was greatness after
all? Merely a matter of viewpoint
perhaps.</p>

<p>Smith got up and moved slowly
toward his tent. Out in the shadows
he could feel the grins of the Martians.
"Goodnight," he called.</p>

<p>But there was no answer.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I&nbsp;put</span> them out there," Cleve
said. "It seemed as good a place
as any."</p>

<p>"Fine," Larkin rumbled. He wore
boots and britches and a big, wide-brimmed
hat. He had on soft leather
gloves. He looked like an empire
builder.</p>

<p>The Martians were standing
around grinning at the pile of
shovels lying in the fuzz-bush. The
Martians seemed interested and appeared
to communicate with one
another in some imperceptible manner.</p>

<p>Larkin shoved through the circle
of green men, pushing rudely. He
stopped, picked up one of the
shovels; thrust it toward a Martian.
The Martian took it in his hands.</p>

<p>"It's very important that you <i>tell</i>
them&mdash;that you don't show them,"
Cleve said. "You must not do any
of the work yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll handle it," Larkin snapped.
"Now, you&mdash;all of you! Grab a
shovel. Pick 'em up, see? Pick 'em
up! We've got work to do. A ditch
to dig."</p>

<p>Larkin's pantomime was a universal
language. "We start the ditch
here. Right here&mdash;you fella! Get
digging! And put your back into
that shovel. Hit hard or maybe it
gives the whip&mdash;understand?" Larkin
made a threatening motion toward
the lash coiled at his belt.</p>

<p>Smith, already on the scene,
turned as Evans and Dane arrived
carrying undefined plastic. They
snapped the cylinders and chairs
appeared; chairs&mdash;and a table upon
which Carter and Lewis, bringing
up the rear, placed a pitcher of
beer, glasses and a box of cigars.</p>

<p>Cleve, the psychologist, looked
with satisfaction upon the string of
Martians manipulating the shovels.
"All right," he said. "Let's sit down.
Pour the beer, one of you."</p>

<p>"Allow me," Smith said. He
fought to straighten the smile bending
his lips. He picked up the
pitcher and poured beer into the
glasses. It all seemed so absurd;
these grim-faced men acting out an
asinine tableau.</p>

<p>Cleve caught the smile. "I wish
you'd take this seriously," he said.
"It's a mighty touchy and important
business."</p>

<p>"Sorry," Smith said, raising his
glass. "Here's to empire."</p>

<p>Larkin was striding up and down
the line of straining Martians. The
scowl had become a part of him.</p>

<p><i>It's getting him</i>, Smith marveled.
<i>Act or no act, he likes it. Experiment
or not, he's in his element.</i></p>

<p>The six men sat drinking their
beer and watching Larkin. But only
Cleve was aware of the skill with
which the man worked. The gradual
application of pressure; the
careful moving forward from bog
to bog with the path of retreat always
open. From sharpness to
brusqueness. From the brusque to
the harsh. From the harsh to the
brutal.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me," Smith asked,
"why we have to sit here drinking
like a pack of fools? I don't like
beer."</p>

<p>"I'm not enjoying it, either,"
Cleve said. "But you can certainly
understand that the roles must be
set right from the beginning. They
must understand we are their masters,
so we must conduct ourselves
in that manner. Never any sign that
could be interpreted as compromise."</p>

<p>Larkin, satisfied with the progress
of the entirely useless ditch,
came to the table and raised a glass
of beer. He wiped the foam from
his mustache and asked, "What do
you think?" directing the question
toward Cleve.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> latter regarded the sweating
Martians with calculating eyes.
"It's going entirely as I predicted.
The next step is in order, I believe."</p>

<p>"You think it's safe?"</p>

<p>"I'm certain of it."</p>

<p>Smith, studying Larkin, saw the
latter smile, and was again struck
by its quality.</p>

<p><i>Whatever the test, Larkin's for it,
even above the call of scientific experimentation.</i></p>

<p>Larkin was uncoiling the whip
from his belt. He strode toward the
fast-deepening ditch. He selected a
subject. "You&mdash;fella. You're lazy,
huh? You like to gold-brick it?
Then see how you like this!" He
laid the whip across the green
shoulders of the Martian.</p>

<p>The Martian winced. He raised
an arm to shield off the whip.
Again it curled against his flesh. He
whimpered. His grin was stark, inquiring.</p>

<p>"Hit that shovel, you green bastard!"
Larkin roared.</p>

<p>The Martian understood. So did
the other Martians. Their muscles
quivered as they drove into their
work.</p>

<p>Larkin came back, smiling&mdash;almost
dreamily, Smith thought.
Cleve said, "Excellent. I'd hardly
hoped for such conformity. Hardly
expected it."</p>

<p>"You mean," Smith asked, "that
this little scene can be projected
from a dozen to a hundred? From
a hundred to a thousand&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"From this little plot to the whole,
surface of the planet," Cleve said.
"The mass is nothing more than a
collection of individuals. Control
the individual and you've got the
mob. That is if you follow through
with the original method. Set the
hard pattern."</p>

<p>"Then we're in&mdash;is that it?
They've passed every test with flying
colors."</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will," Cleve said,
frowning. "But we must be thorough."</p>

<p>"There's still another test?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The test of final and complete
subservience. It must be proven
beyond all doubt that they know
their masters."</p>

<p>"You don't think they're aware
yet that we <i>are</i> their masters?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure they know. It only remains
to be proven." Cleve glanced
up at Larkin. "Maybe this is as far
as we should go today. We've made
marvelous progress."</p>

<p>That characteristic wave of Larkin's
hand; the gesture of the empire
builder brushing away mountains.
"Why wait? I want to get this
thing over with. You said yourself
they're under our thumb."</p>

<p>Cleve pondered, staring at the
Martians. "Very well. There's really
no reason to wait."</p>

<p>Larkin smiled and turned toward
the diggers, only half visible now
from the depths of the ditch. He
walked forward, appearing to exercise
more care, this time, in the
selection of his subject. Finally, he
pointed at one of the Martians.
"You&mdash;fella! Come here!"</p>

<p>Several of them looked at one
another a trifle confused. "You&mdash;damn
it! What are you waiting
for?"</p>

<p>One of them climbed slowly from
the trench. While he was engaged
in so doing, Smith noticed two
things. He saw the look of rage,
simulated or otherwise, that came
into Larkin's face. And he saw
Cleve's fingers tighten on the edge
of the table.</p>

<p>Larkin had a gun in his fist; a
roar in his voice. "When I talk&mdash;you
jump! Get that? All of you!"</p>

<p>He fired three bullets into the
Martian's brain. The latter slumped
grinning to the ground. Larkin, his
breath coming jerkily, stood poised
on the balls of his feet. The men at
the table sat frozen&mdash;waiting.
Around them&mdash;on the plain&mdash;some
two hundred Martians stood motionless.</p>

<p><i>The final test</i>, Smith thought. <i>To
prove they're cattle.</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;full</span> minute passed after the
echo of the gun faded out. Silence.</p>

<p>And nothing.</p>

<p>The Earthmen picked up their
breathing where they'd dropped it.
Larkin's breath exploded in savage
voice&mdash;triumphant voice. The Martians
were his.</p>

<p>"Come on, some of you! Dig a
hole and bury that carrion! And if
anybody still wonders who's boss
around here&mdash;let him step forward!"</p>

<p>"They took it!" Cleve whispered.
"Glory be&mdash;they took it!"</p>

<p>Four Martians climbed grinning
from the trench. They faced Larkin
and stood as though awaiting instructions.</p>

<p>"Dig there," Larkin said.</p>

<p>They went stolidly to work and
Larkin pocketed his gun, making
the pocketing a gesture of contempt.</p>

<p>"You see," Cleve said, with the
tone of one explaining an abstract
problem, "we were at somewhat of
a disadvantage because they are incapable
of indicating emotion by
facial expression. Thus the last test
was necessary. If we could have
judged the degree of fear previously
instilled, that last might not have
been necessary."</p>

<p>"Just as well to have a double
check nonetheless," Dane said.
"Look at them! You'd think nothing
out of the ordinary had happened."</p>

<p>Larkin strode back to the table.
"Glad we got it over with," he said.
"Now we <i>know</i>. Cleve can head
back for Earth tomorrow. Initial
supplies will come to about twenty
million, I estimate. The rest of us
can stay here and really drive these
beggars. Get the foundations dug;
get the rock down from the hills."</p>

<p>"A planet in glorious resurrection,"
said Dane, the poet of the
group.</p>

<p>"They've got the grave dug,"
Cleve observed. "They're waiting
for orders."</p>

<p>"Such cattle," Evans muttered.</p>

<p>Larkin strode back to the grave.
He pointed. "Him&mdash;body into the
grave. Snap into it. We've got work
to do."</p>

<p>The Martians put the body into
the grave.</p>

<p>Then a tall, green man appeared
behind Larkin. He put his arms
around Larkin's body. Another
Martian took the gun from Larkin's
pocket.</p>

<p>And they pushed the screaming
Earthman down into the grave.</p>

<p>Smith sprang to his feet. "For
God's sake!"</p>

<p>"Sit down, you fool!" Cleve
hissed. "Do you want to die? We've
miscalculated. Something's wrong."</p>

<p>The big Martian was standing
on Larkin. The others threw in the
soil. Larkin, now beyond sanity, was
gibbering like an animal.</p>

<p>Smith sat down. The Earthman
presented a frozen tableau. Soon
the gibbering could no longer be
heard and the big Martian stepped
out of the grave.</p>

<p>"Leave everything," Cleve whispered.
"Get up very casually and
walk back to the ship. Get inside
it."</p>

<p>"May God help us," Dane
quavered.</p>

<p>"Shut up! Act natural."</p>

<p>They went back and got into the
ship while the Martians stood
patiently about waiting for something
to happen. Their patience
was rewarded when the ship arose
on a great flaming tail from the surface
of the planet.</p>

<p>It was a sight worth waiting for.</p>
